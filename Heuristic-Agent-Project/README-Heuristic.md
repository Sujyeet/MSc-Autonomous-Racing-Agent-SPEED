# Heuristic Agent Project

This folder contains the implementation of a heuristic-based autonomous racing agent.

## Overview

The heuristic agent uses rule-based algorithms and traditional control methods to navigate racing environments. This approach provides:

- Interpretable decision-making
- Fast execution times
- Baseline performance for comparison with learning-based methods

## Key Features

- **Path Planning**: Optimal trajectory calculation using geometric algorithms
- **Speed Control**: Velocity management based on track curvature and conditions
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Rule-based collision prevention
- **Track Analysis**: Real-time environment assessment

## Implementation

The heuristic agent is implemented using classical control theory and optimization techniques including:

- PID controllers for steering and throttle
- A* pathfinding algorithms
- Geometric calculations for racing lines
- Safety mechanisms and fallback behaviors

## Usage

Detailed implementation and usage instructions will be added as development progresses.

## Performance

Benchmark results and performance metrics will be documented here once testing is complete.
