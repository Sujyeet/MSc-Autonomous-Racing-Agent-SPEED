# Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent Project

This folder contains the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) autonomous racing agent.

## Overview

The DRL agent uses neural networks and reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal racing strategies through interaction with the environment. This approach provides:

- Adaptive learning capabilities
- Complex strategy development
- Performance improvement through experience
- State-of-the-art autonomous racing techniques

## Key Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, Actor-Critic algorithms
- **Environment Integration**: Compatible with racing simulators and real-world scenarios
- **Training Pipeline**: Automated training with experience replay and target networks
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for deployment

## Algorithms Implemented

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Experience replay buffer
- Target network stabilization
- Double DQN improvements
- Dueling network architecture

### Policy Gradient Methods
