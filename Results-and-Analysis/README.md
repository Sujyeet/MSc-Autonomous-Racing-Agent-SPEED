## Key Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Lap Time**: Average and best lap times across different tracks
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful lap completions
- **Collision Rate**: Number of collisions per lap
- **Track Coverage**: Percentage of optimal racing line followed
- **Speed Consistency**: Variance in speed across track sections

### Evaluation Criteria
- Safety (collision avoidance)
- Speed (lap time optimization)
- Consistency (performance repeatability)
- Adaptability (performance on new tracks)
- Efficiency (computational resource usage)

## Experimental Setup
